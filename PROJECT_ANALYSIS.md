## Missing Features & Issues üöß

### Critical Issues
1. **VLC Detection**: Need better error handling when VLC is not installed
2. **Cross-Platform VLC Paths**: VLC installation paths vary by OS
3. **Error Handling**: Limited user feedback for failed operations
4. **Loading States**: Inconsistent loading indicators

### Missing Core Features
1. **Search Filters**: No advanced filtering (quality, year, genre)
2. **Streaming Quality Selection**: No option to choose torrent quality
3. **Download Progress**: No download progress indicators in VLC
4. **Resume Playback**: Basic resume but no advanced seeking integration
5. **Playlist/Queue**: No queue system for multiple videos
6. **Subtitles**: Limited subtitle support through VLC
7. **Cast Support**: No screen casting integration

### User Experience Issues
1. **Search Results**: No pagination or infinite scroll
2. **Empty States**: Poor handling of no results/error states
3. **Navigation**: Limited navigation between sections
4. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: No lazy loading or code splitting optimization

### Technical Debt
1. **Code Organization**: Components could be better structured
2. **Type Safety**: Some TypeScript usage could be improved
3. **Testing**: No unit or integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation
5. **Electron Security**: Need to review and improve Electron security settings
5. **Environment Management**: Environment variables not well documented

## Conclusion üìù

The Watchify project has a solid foundation with working core functionality. The recent fix of moving to Netlify serverless functions eliminates the major architectural flaw of requiring a local proxy. The focus should now be on:

1. **Stabilizing the core experience** with better error handling and loading states
2. **Enhancing the search and streaming experience** with advanced features
3. **Professionalizing the codebase** with testing, documentation, and monitoring
4. **Planning for scale** with proper infrastructure and business considerations

The project is ready for the next phase of development with a clear roadmap for growth and professionalization.
